GSE124703,CRISPR interference-based platform for multimodal genetic screens in human iPSC-derived neurons,"Human iPSCs engineered to express mNGN2 under a doxycycline-inducible system in the AAVS1 safe harbor locus were used for the differentiation protocol below. iPSCs were released and centrifuged as above, and pelleted cells were resuspended in N2 Pre-Differentiation Medium containing the following: Knockout DMEM/F12 (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 12660-012) as the base, 1X MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 11140-050), 1X N2 Supplement (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat.

No. D3447-500MG) to induce expression of mNGN2. iPSCs were counted and plated at 7 × 105 cells per Matrigel-coated well of a 6-well plate in 2mL of N2 Pre-Differentiation Medium, or at 4 × 106 cells per Matrigel-coated 10-cm dish in 12mL of medium, for three days…",14 days,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813890/
GSE233916,Mutant Huntingtin impairs neurodevelopment in human brain organoids through CHCHD2-mediated neurometabolic failure,"For NGN2 neurons derived from healthy iPSCs and HD iPSCs, we employed NPCs derived from control iPSCs (C1, C2, C3) and from HD patient-derived iPSCs (H1, H2, H3). The protocol was modified from a published protocol51. For NGN2 virus production, HEK 293 cells were seeded at 70% confluency in DMEM medium in a 150 cm2 dish. After cell attachment, the medium was replaced and supplemented with 25 µM Chloroquine and the cells were transfected according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and the following plasmid mix: 8.1 µg pMD2.G, 12.2 µg pMDLg-pRRE, 5.4 µg pRSV-Rev, 5.4 µg FUW-M2-rtTA, 14.3 µg TetO-FUW-NGN2, 14.3 µg TetO-FUW-EGFP. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM-F12 (Gibco, USA) and 10 µM sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Virus-containing supernatant was collected 24 h and 48 h later. To concentrate the virus particles, the supernatant was first centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove cells and debris and then mixed with 1 volume of cold Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bio, Japan) to every 3 volumes of lentivirus-containing supernatant and kept overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS (Gibco, USA), 1:100 of the original volume. Virus aliquots were stored at −80 °C until further use. For NGN2 neuron generation and culture, 2.5 × 106 NPCs per well were seeded on a Matrigel-coated (Corning, USA) 6-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, USA) using sm+ medium (see NPC generation for media composition). After cells attached (2–24 h), the medium was replaced and supplemented with 4 µg/ml polybrene and 2.25 × 106 transducing units of both EGFP and NGN2 lentivirus. On the next day (day 0), the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and 3 volumes sm+ medium mixed with 1 volume NGN2 medium (Neurobasal, 1x B-27 supplement, 1x NEAA, 2 mM Glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml Pen/Strep [all Gibco, USA], 1x MycoZap-Plus-CL [Lonza, Switzerland], 10 ng/ml human NT-3 [PeproTech, USA], 10 ng/ml human BDNF [R&D Systems, USA]) supplemented with 2 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). On day 3, medium was changed to 100% NGN2 medium supplemented with 0.8 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). On day 5, the selection process was stopped by replacing medium without antibiotics. Medium was changed every other day until day 14, where the cells were harvested for subsequent experiments.",14 days,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51216-w#Sec10
GSE144857,Molecular convergence between Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome identified using human pluripotent stem cell models,"Human neurons were generated as previously described (Nehme et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013). In brief, hPSCs were transduced with TetO-Ngn2-T2A-Puro and Ubiq-rtTA lentivirus or TetO-Ngn2-P2A-Zeo and CAG-rtTA were integrated into the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus using TALENs. Cells were then treated with doxycycline to induce ectopic Ngn2 expression combined with the extrinsic addition of SMAD inhibitors (SB431542, 1614, Tocris, and LDN-193189, 04–0074, Stemgent), Wnt inhibitors (XAV939, 04–0046, Stemgent) and neurotrophins (BDNF, GDNF, CNTF) followed by puromycin treatment to eliminate uninfected stem cells and maintenance in Neurobasal medium. Neurons were analyzed at day 14 of in vitro differentiation, a time point at which previous studies support connectivity and prenatal neuronal gene expression programs (Nehme et al., 2018; Susco et al., 2020).

Day 0 of differentiation was started when the cells reached 70 to 80% confluency. Cells were detached with accutase (Sigma Aldrich, A6964) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 minutes. Detached cells were transferred to a Falcon tube and centrifuged for 5 min 300rcf. Cells were resuspended in differentiation medium mTers1 supplemented with fresh cytokines with 50 ng/mL BMP-4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, 20 ng/mL SCF (differentiation medium 1) and 10 μM Rock Inhibitor. 10.000–15.000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well U-bottom ultra-low adherence plate (Corning, 7007) and the plate was centrifuged at 100 rcf for 5 min to ensure clustering of the cells at the bottom of the well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",18 Days,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42096-7#Sec14
